## Sequences of the LTR of LTR retrotransposons
Each LTR retrotransposon with two LTRs present was identified by manual alignment and dotplot.
The LTR terminii were verified by the presence of a target site duplication and polypurine tract.

## Naming of copies
Individual copies are named relative to the Kindr copy they are nearest. 
Ex. ```3p_d13_B9``` is the 3 prime LTR (orientation of the contig, not necessarily the TE) of copy downstream 13, downstream of Kindr copy B9.
