# haplotype blocks

Required software:

- R packages
	- APE
	- ??

Most of the alignment and TE identification is done by hand. Can include sequences of each identified TE, as well as positions on BAC contigs when these are known.

Calculate the age of each LTR TE with intact LTRS with ```calculate_ages_LTRs.R```

Identify parsimony informative SNPs ```pars_inform_snps.py```

Plot everything and polarize ```plot_haplotypes.R```
