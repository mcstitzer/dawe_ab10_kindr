# Assemble tripsacum sequence from HapMap2 data

Software needed:

- phrap 1.090518, specificially, a version that can deal with short read data (ask Phil Green)
- bwa mem
- samtools
- bedtools
- qiime ## although I have changed this! think about whether I should here as well.
- mafft

Once Kindr has a NCBI accession number, can grab that as well here, but just including the fasta reference of ZmKindr CDS and ZmKin11 CDS for now.
