# scan for positive selection using BUSTED


These alignments were uploaded to the hyphy webserver (http://test.datamonkey.org/busted)
The branch subtending Kindr copies was selected as the foreground branch for branch/site analyses.

Since the first exon of Kindr contains a region duplicated from the first exon of Kin11 (See Fig. 2), we repeated the analysis twice, once with the upstream sequence replacing the homologous region in Kindr gene copies, and again with the downstream portion of the Kindr copies. 

Plotting the homologous regions of the upstream and downstream exon is done in ```pos_sel_plot.Rmd```.
