Set up libraries
```{r}
library(ape)
library(phangorn)
```

Plot aa positions.
```{r}
aln=read.dna('~/Dropbox/ab10/ALLkindrCDS_plus_Kindrlogs_only_full_length_genbank_TranslatorX_Prank_align.fasta', format='fasta', as.matrix=T)
aa=trans(aln)
image(aa, cex=0.5)
```
Read in the BUSTED results and plot them on the alignment. 
```{r}
upstream=read.csv('~/Documents/dawe_ab10_kindr/positive_selection/upstream_busted.csv')
downstream=read.csv('~/Documents/dawe_ab10_kindr/positive_selection/downstream_busted.csv')
```

At site 114, we switch to the conserved region that is idential between both alignments.

```{r}
plot(upstream$site_index, upstream$er_constrained)
points(downstream$site_index, downstream$er_constrained, col='red')

```
